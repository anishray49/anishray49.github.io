I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Houston since August 2025. Before this, I completed the B.Sc. (Hons.) in Mathematics and Computing programme at the Institute of Mathematics and Applications, Bhubaneswar, affiliated with the Utkal University. Then I joined the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Münster in Germany in October 2020, where I completed the M.Sc. Mathematics programme in June 2023. I am interested in Analytic Number Theory, L-functions, Automorphic Forms, and Equidistribution problems in Number Theory and Homogeneous Dynamics.
